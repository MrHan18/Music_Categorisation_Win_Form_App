Everything Black;Unlike Pluto;Everything Black;3:49;Shadows fall over my heart. I black out the moon. I wait for you to come around. You got me dancing in the dark (dancing in the dark). I've closed my eyes. But I won't sleep tonight. Baby, you should come with me. I'll take you to the dark side. Me and you, you and me. Do bad things in the night time. Baby, you should come with me. And we can kill the lights. Hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout. Hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout (woo!). Black bird, black moon, black sky, black light. Black, everything black. Black heart, black keys, black diamonds. Blackout, black, everything black. Black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything black. In a nocturnal state of mind. Children of the night. But it's the only way alive. This black hole's pulling me inside. Of this black heart, this black soul. Underneath this black, black sky. Baby, you should come with me. I'll take you to the dark side. Me and you, you and me. Do bad things in the night time. Baby, you should come with me. And we can kill the lights. Hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout. Hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout (woo!). Black bird, black moon, black sky, black light. Black, everything black. Black heart, black keys, black diamonds. Blackout, black, everything black. Black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything black. Baby, you should come with me. Me and you, you and me. Baby, you should come with me. And we can kill the lights. Hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout. Hit the lights, let it blackout, blackout (woo!). Black bird, black moon, black sky, black light. Black, everything black. Black heart, black keys, black diamonds. Blackout, black, everything black. Black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything. All black, everything, everything black
Feel It Still;Portugal. The Man;Woordstock;2:43;Can't keep my hands to myself. Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf. In case my little baby girl is in need. Am I coming out of left field?. Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now. I been feeling it since 1966, now. Might be over now, but I feel it still. Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now. Let me kick it like it's 1986, now. Might be over now, but I feel it still. Got another mouth to feed. Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger. Gone with the fallen leaves. Am I coming out of left field?. Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now. I been feeling it since 1966, now. Might've had your fill, but you feel it still. Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now. Let me kick it like it's 1986, now. Might be over now, but I feel it still. We could fight a war for peace. (Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now). Give in to that easy living. Goodbye to my hopes and dreams. Start flipping for my enemies. We could wait until the walls come down. (Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now). It's time to give a little to the. Kids in the middle, but, oh until it falls. Won't bother me. Is it coming?. Is it coming?. Is it coming?. Is it coming?. Is it coming?. Is it coming back?. Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah. Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now. Might be over now, but I feel it still. Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now. I've been feeling it since 1966, now. Might be over now, but I feel it still. Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now. Let me kick it like it's 1986, now. Might be over now, but I feel it still. Might've had your fill, but I feel it still
Gimme What I Want;Miley Cyrus;Plastic Hearts;2:32;Midnight and the moon is out. Careful, you might hurt yourself. Pleasure leads to pain. To me they're both the same. Sweat dripping down to the floor. Bite marks like an animal. You might be insane. But maybe we're the same. Tonight, you came here. 'Cause you know what I need. And no one likes to be alone. I don't need a future. I don't need your past. I just need a lover. So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my. Self-inflicted torture. You don't have to ask. I just need a lover. So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself. I can tell that you're new to this. Slow it down but you can't resist. Feed your fantasy. Give yourself to me. Tonight, you came here. 'Cause you know what I need. And no one likes to be alone. I don't need a future. I don't need you're past. I just need a lover. So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my. Self-inflicted torture. You don't have to ask. I just need a lover. So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself. Give it to me, babe. (Give it to me, babe). Give it to me, babe. (Give it to me, babe). Give it to me and nobody else, babe. Give it to me, babe. (Give it to me, babe). Give it to me, babe. (Give it to me, babe). Give it to me and nobody else, babe. Gimme what I want. Gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself
